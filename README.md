# HeIIFOAM

Description
    This is the solver created by Cyprien Soulaine for

    solving the He(II) superfluid equations. The solver is based on the Super-PISO
	algorithm.

Tutorials
	
	The package comes with different examples (just run HellFoam in a terminal, the grid and 
	initialization are already set up)
		* capillaryGorterMellink: solve superfluid helium flow in a tube in the Gorter-Mellink
			regime. Simulation results can be compared with analytical solutions
			(see Soulaine et al. 2015, section 4.2)
		* capillaryWithCylindersGorterMellink: solve superfluid helium flow in a porous medium 
			model (a capillary containing several solid cylinders) in the Gorter-Mellink regime
			(see Soulaine et al. 2015, section 4.4)
